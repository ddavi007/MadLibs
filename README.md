## What is Mad Libs

Mad Libs is a word-based application that prompts a user to input words; then, the program will output a story using the words entered.

## How it works

When the user executes the program, they will receive instructions in the console.
The user is asked to enter several nouns, adjectives and adverbs; the validity of each input is checked using a dictionary. If the user's entry doesn't match the requested input type, they'll receive an error, and the system will request an alternative. Once the user has successfully entered all figures correctly, a somewhat random story will be printed.
